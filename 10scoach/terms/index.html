                        You and Bridger Apps agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved exclusively through binding individual arbitration rather than in court, except that: (a) either party may assert claims in small claims court if the claims qualify; and (b) either party may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights.

If your claim does not exceed $10,000, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing.
